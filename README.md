E-Commerce Website Manual Testing Project
Introduction
Welcome to my GitHub repository for the E-Commerce Website Manual Testing Project. As a passionate and motivated fresher in the field of software testing, I completed a 6-month internship at Design Techno, where I honed my manual testing skills by working on various modules of an e-commerce website.

Project Overview
In this project, I meticulously tested key functionalities of the e-commerce website, ensuring its smooth operation and a seamless user experience. The primary modules I focused on include:

Login and Logout: I thoroughly tested the login and logout functionalities, verifying that users can securely access their accounts and log out without any issues. This included testing for valid and invalid credentials, session management, and error handling.

Add to Cart: I conducted extensive testing on the "Add to Cart" feature, ensuring that users can easily add products to their shopping carts. I verified that the selected items are correctly displayed in the cart and that quantity adjustments and removals work as expected.

Registration: I tested the registration process to guarantee that new users can create accounts without any obstacles. This involved validation of user input, confirmation emails, and account activation procedures.

Testing Methodology
Throughout this project, I employed a systematic testing approach to identify defects and ensure the website's functionality adheres to its intended design. My methodology included:

Writing comprehensive test cases and test scripts for each module.
Executing both positive and negative test scenarios to cover various edge cases.
Reporting and tracking defects using industry-standard tools.
Conducting regression testing to confirm that previously identified issues were resolved.
Collaborating with developers to ensure timely issue resolution.
Achievements
During the course of this project, I successfully contributed to the improvement of the website's reliability and user-friendliness. My efforts resulted in the discovery and resolution of several critical issues, ultimately enhancing the overall quality of the e-commerce platform.

Future Work
As I continue to develop my skills and gain more experience in software testing, I plan to expand this project by including additional modules and incorporating automated testing techniques to increase efficiency and coverage.

Conclusion
This E-Commerce Website Manual Testing Project showcases my dedication to quality assurance and my ability to thoroughly evaluate software applications. I invite you to explore the project's code, test cases, and documentation to gain insights into my testing capabilities.
